# CS3012 Software Engineering

## First Assignment - LCA:
Files are in the "test" folder. The files involved for this assignment are "binarytree.py" and "testBinaryTree.py"

## Second Assignment - DAG:
I created two new files called "directedAcyclicGraph.py" and "testDAG.py"

## Third Assignment - Software Engineer Essay:
The essay is called "SoftwareEngineerEssay.pdf". Ignore the most recent commit on this file. I accidentally overwrote the original commit for this file with another commit for another file, so if you're wonder why it seems like I worked on it past the deadline, if you could check the commit log for that file, you can see that I did have it uploaded on time, I just messed up my git commit command at some point at a later stage.

I completely forgot to add my references, hope it's still ok to add references here:

## Fourth Assignment - Measuring Software Engineering Essay:
The essay is called "Software Engineering Essay.pdf"

## Fifth Assignment - GitHub API:
File is called "github_api.py" where I used the PyGitHub library in Python.

## Sixth Assignment - Data Visualisation:
Gets the Top 100 Repositories in GitHub in order of most starred and plots them onto a plot graph. It compares its stars with the number of commits the repo has had in the present year. 

As well as that on the side of the HTML, it includes hyperlinks to the repos of the Top 10 Repositories in order of the most starred.

On the graph, by clicking on the magnifying glass and selecting over an area, it zooms into the graph so that you can have a closer look at the plots like so:

I used Flask as the framework to serve. I used the library matplotlib in order to plot the data onto a graph. Overall, I did the assignment primarily in Python.
