# CS3012 Software Engineering

## First Assignment - LCA:
Files are in the "test" folder. The files involved for this assignment are "binarytree.py" and "testBinaryTree.py"

## Second Assignment - DAG:
I created two new files called "directedAcyclicGraph.py" and "testDAG.py"

## Third Assignment - Software Engineer Essay:
The essay is called "SoftwareEngineerEssay.pdf". Ignore the most recent commit on this file. I accidentally overwrote the original commit for this file with another commit for another file, so if you're wonder why it seems like I worked on it past the deadline, if you could check the commit log for that file, you can see that I did have it uploaded on time, I just messed up my git commit command at some point at a later stage.

The essay is called "Software Engineering Essay.pdf"
